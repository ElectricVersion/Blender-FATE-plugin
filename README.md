# Blender-FATE-plugin
Plugin to import and export model files from WildTangent's game "FATE".

So far it can only import MDL files. In the future, it will be able to export as well.

## Installation
Download the repository as a Zip file. Then open Blender (2.9+) and in the ``Edit ->  Preferences -> Addons`` tab, click "Install" and select the file you downloaded.

SMS support is planned, but not included yet
